Intruder Detection System
Overview
The Intruder Detection System is a machine learning-based project designed to identify and classify potential intrusions in a network. The system utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and Random Forrest model to detect various types of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

Features
Multi-class Classification: Detects multiple types of DoS attacks.
Cross-Validation: Evaluates model performance using 10-fold cross-validation.
Performance Metrics: Calculates accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Confusion Matrix: Provides a detailed view of classification performance.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
pandas
scikit-learn
numpy
